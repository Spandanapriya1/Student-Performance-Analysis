**Student Performance Analysis**

**Project Overview**

This project is a thorough data analysis study designed to identify the main variables influencing student success. We examine the effects of demographics, study habits, parental education, alcohol use, and support networks on final grades (G3) using Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

 The project helps parents, educators, and legislators find ways to improve student performance and academic success by utilizing statistical association analysis, data visualization, and predictive insights.

**Project Objectives**

Examine the distribution of students' final grades (G3) to identify patterns in academic achievement.
Determine the main relationships that exist between academic achievement and elements like study time, family support, and alcohol use.
Analyze how student grades are affected by the educational attainment of the parents (Medu, Fedu).
Analyze how family structure and extracurricular activities affect students' learning.
Examine how drinking alcohol during the week and on the weekends affects academic performance.
Offer data-based suggestions for raising student achievement.

**Dataset Overview**

(i) Academic records of students are included in the dataset, including:

Gender, family size, parental education, and cohabitation status are among the demographic details.
Academic Performance: Number of prior failures, study time, and final grades (G3).
Social and behavioral factors: involvement in extracurricular activities, support networks, and alcohol use on the weekends (Walc) and during the week (Dalc).
Family Support & Educational Influence: school support (schoolsup), family support (famsup), and parental education level (Fedu, Medu).

(ii) Data Source: This dataset, which includes both category and numerical variables for analysis, was gathered from students taking mathematics classes.

**Data Processing & Cleaning**

**1. Data Loading & Preprocessing**

Pandas was used to load the dataset, and info() and head() were used to give an overview.
To guarantee data consistency, missing values were looked for and dealt with utilizing forward fill (ffill).
For optimal analysis, categorical variables (such as family size, sex, address, and school) were transformed into category data types.

**2. Handling Missing Values & Data Imputation**

For numerical and categorical features, respectively, mean and mode imputation approaches were used to fill in the missing values.
For improved readability, duplicate records were eliminated and column formats were standardized.

**3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

We used Seaborn and Matplotlib to illustrate several features of the dataset:

Final Grade Distribution (G3): A histogram illustrating the distribution of student grades.
Alcohol Use vs. Grades: Boxplots analyzing the effects of alcohol use on weekdays (Dalc) and weekends (Walc).
Parental Education vs. Student Performance: Examining the relationship between academic achievement and the educational attainment of the father (Fedu) and mother (Medu).
Study Time vs. Grades: Knowing the relationship between performance and study time.
Impact of Family Support and School Support: Assessing how extra learning materials improve student performance.

**Key Analysis & Insights**

**1. Grade Distribution & Performance Trends**

Final grades (G3) are distributed normally, with the majority of pupils receiving mid-range scores.
Academic achievement varies, with a tiny fraction of students receiving extraordinarily high or extremely low scores.
Observation: Students at either extreme of the grade distribution can require more support services or focused interventions.

**2. Impact of Alcohol Consumption on Academic Performance**

There is a significant inverse relationship between final grades and alcohol use during the week (Dalc).
Academic performance is also adversely affected by weekend alcohol use (Walc), but to a lower degree.
Conclusion: Higher alcohol use is associated with poorer academic achievement, underscoring the need for more effective student awareness initiatives.

**3. Parental Education Influence on Grades**

Students do noticeably better when their parents are more educated (Medu, Fedu).
There is a significant positive link between final grades (G3) and the education of the mother (Medu) and father (Fedu).
Implication: Academic performance is significantly influenced by parental educational attainment, indicating the significance of home learning contexts.

**4. Study Time & Past Failures Impact on Performance**

Higher final grades are typically attained by students who study more.
Final grades are adversely affected by more prior failures, suggesting a pattern of subpar academic achievement.
Suggestion: To assist difficult students in overcoming past setbacks and enhancing their performance, schools ought to offer remedial programs.

**5. Family Support & Educational Influence**

Students who receive additional family support (famsup) and school support (schoolsup) typically perform better academically.
A higher grade is positively correlated with involvement in extracurricular activities.
Actionable Insight: Academic achievement can be increased by promoting family involvement in education and organized extracurricular activities.

**Visualizations & Key Findings**

**1.Correlation Heatmap**

Shows how study time, parental education, alcohol use, and final grades are related (G3).

**(i) Highest Positive Associations:**

final grades and the educational attainment of the parents (Medu, Fedu).
Academic success and study time.

**(ii) Maximum Negative Associations:**

Final grades and alcohol consumption during the week.
Final grades and past failures.

**2. Boxplots & Distribution Graphs**

Study Time vs. Grades: Students that put in more study time do better academically.
Alcohol Use vs. Performance: Students who drink more alcohol receive worse grades.
Parental Education and Academic Achievement: Students who have more educated parents perform better academically.
Academic Achievement & Family Support: Students who have educational support networks do better academically.
